## Age To Version - jquery Plugin

This's a simple frame for creating jquery extensions with qUnit.

But it also can change your age to version. How geeky this is? oh, very!

Example:

````
  <span id="birth-day">1999-07-07</span>

  <script type="text/javascript">
    $('birth-day').ageToVersion();
  </script>
````

This will replace your age with: 12.03.22
